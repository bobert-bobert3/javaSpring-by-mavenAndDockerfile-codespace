	 Originally, a different default image (base image) was used, for this codespace. The
	 original image was determined by the below commented out properties: "name", "dockerComposeFile", and "service".
	 
	 However, once I figured out how to configure pairs of "Dockerfile" and "compose.yaml"
	 files, outside of the codespace's ".devcontainer" folder, I preferred that approach.
	 That is, the preference was to use a folder named "my-images" vs. the codespace's
	 ".devcontainer" folder.
